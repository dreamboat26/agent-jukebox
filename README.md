# Groq Function Calling

## Introduction

This README guide outlines the steps for calling Groq functions, which encapsulate specific functionality within your Groq schema or query logic. By following these steps, you can efficiently reuse and execute predefined operations in your queries.

## Steps to Call Groq Functions

1) Define Function: Groq functions are defined within your Groq schema or query logic. They encapsulate specific functionality that you want to reuse.

2) Import Function: If your function is defined in a separate module or file, you'll need to import it into the script or environment where you want to use it.

3) Call Function: Once imported, you can call the Groq function like any other function in your code. Pass any necessary arguments to the function.

4) Process Results: Handle the results returned by the function as needed for your application.

## Conclusion

Calling Groq functions enhances the reusability and modularity of your Groq queries. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can efficiently utilize predefined functionality and streamline your query development process.
